### In this project I apply basic HTML with a little CSS, thus learning to:
1. create a main page and within it href links to other pages on a different directory.
1. display text via headings, lists and paragraphs.
1. display images.
1. align elements.
1. get a sense of the limitations of composition and arrangement of elements with just html.

### This project also allowed me to:
1. learn and understand version control and how to use git.
1. learn how to make atomic commits
1. organize files appropriately

### Looking back:
1. I was not aware of block or external css and how cluttered a script can get when using inline CSS
